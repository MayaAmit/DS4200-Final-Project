            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Music is a universal language that evolves alongside society,
                reflecting cultural shifts, technological advancements, and
                historical events. Analyzing music data trends over time provides
                valuable insights into what styles, genres, and themes resonate
                with listeners. From an artist's perspective, understanding these
                trends can help shape creative decisions and predict what will be
                popular in the future. Additionally, contextualizing music trends
                with historical events offers a unique perspective on how music
                both influences and is influenced by the world around it. This
                involves cross-analyzing shifts in musical themes, genres, and
                popularity with major societal changes. For example, protest songs
                surged during the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War, with
                artists like Bob Dylan and Marvin Gaye using music as a form of
                activism. Similarly, the rise of electronic and dance music in
                the late 20th century coincided with technological advancements
                and the growth of club culture. Economic downturns, such as the
                2008 financial crisis, and global events like the COVID-19 pandemic,
                may also introduce shifts in music that would be interesting to
                explore. Overall, this analysis can help us better understand how
                music serves as both a reaction to and a driver of cultural change.

            <h2>About the Data</h2>
            <p>
                The data we will be using was sourced from the Kaggle 15,000
                Music Tracks - 19 Genres (w/ Spotify Data) dataset. The dataset
                contains 15,150 rows and 18 columns. It is a collection of popular
                songs spanning from 1923 to 2023. It categorizes each song by a
                combination of objective and subjective metrics. Some examples
                of objective features are the track title, artist name, release
                year, duration, and tempo. Some examples of subjective features
                are danceability, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, and
                valence. It was collected from Spotify by scraping hits by genre
                and removing all duplicate track title + artist entries. It is
                important to note that although the dataset contains 15,150 rows,
                there are only 10,400 unique songs. This is because certain songs
                appear in duplicate rows to represent cases where multiple artists
                are credited on the same song. The data is free to use under an
                MIT license.

                <h3>Average Duration Per Decade</h3>
                <div id="lineplot" class="vis-box"></div>
                <p class="vis-description">
                    This line plot illustrates how the average song duration has changed over the decades for each musical genre. 
                    One of the most striking takeaways is how consistent song lengths have remained overallâ€”regardless of genre, 
                    most songs fall between 200 and 350 seconds, or roughly 3 to 5 minutes. A notable exception is jazz, 
                    which peaked at nearly 10 minutes in the 2000s.

                    The "All" line, which averages durations across all genres, reflects this consistency well. 
                    This trend likely stems from the longstanding influence of radio formatting, which favors tracks around
                     3 minutes in length. For example, Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody initially struggled to get airplay due to its 
                     unusually long runtime.
                    
                    Looking within individual genres, we see interesting deviations. EDM, 
                    for instance, shows a clear linear decline in duration over time, 
                    while R&B saw a noticeable spike in average song length during the 1960s to 1980s. 
                    These patterns suggest that while song structure norms persist, each genre evolves 
                    in its own way in response to cultural and technological shifts.

                <h3>Correlation Heatmap of Qualitative Features</h3>

                    <img src="images/qualitative_correlations.png" alt="Correlation Heatmap of Qualitative Music Features" class="vis-image">
                </div>
                <p class="vis-description">
                    This heatmap shows the correlations between the subjective features in our dataset. Becuase qualities like "Danceability"
                    or "Valence" are open to interpretation, we visualize the relationship between these attributes to see how their values trend together.
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is a strong negative correlation (-0.71) between Acousticness and Energy. This may suggest that acoustic songs tend to be calmer. Or it may
                            indicate a bias in the data author to perceive acoustic songs as less energetic compared to other instrumental styles such as electronic or percussive.
                        </li>
                        <li>There is a moderate positive correlation (0.48) between Danceability and Valence. This intuitively aligns with tendency of songs which are popular
                            in party or club atmospheres to evoke positive feelings in the listener, whether through upbeat rhythms, bright melodies, or feel-good lyrics.
                        </li>
                        <li>All other features are weakly correlated. This suggests that many qualities of a song vary independently from one another. For example, the presence of
                            a live audience in a track doesn't tend to hold any predictive power over whether the song contains many lyrics, or is purely instrumental.
                        </li>
                        <li>One noteworthy insight from this matrix is that speechiness and instrumentalness don't have a strong negative correlation, as one might intuitively assume.
                            This may be due to the presence of longer songs, where the instrumentality and lyrics may balance each other out, or because the nature of many lyrical
                            songs to still incorporate a large proportion of instrumental sections. If spoken word poetry were present in the dataset, to counteract the presence
                            of purely instrumental tracks, we would likely see a stronger negative trend.
                        </li>

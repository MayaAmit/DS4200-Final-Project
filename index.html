            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Music is a universal language that evolves alongside society,
                reflecting cultural shifts, technological advancements, and
                historical events. Analyzing music data trends over time provides
                valuable insights into what styles, genres, and themes resonate
                with listeners. From an artist's perspective, understanding these
                trends can help shape creative decisions and predict what will be
                popular in the future. Additionally, contextualizing music trends
                with historical events offers a unique perspective on how music
                both influences and is influenced by the world around it. This
                involves cross-analyzing shifts in musical themes, genres, and
                popularity with major societal changes. For example, protest songs
                surged during the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War, with
                artists like Bob Dylan and Marvin Gaye using music as a form of
                activism. Similarly, the rise of electronic and dance music in
                the late 20th century coincided with technological advancements
                and the growth of club culture. Economic downturns, such as the
                2008 financial crisis, and global events like the COVID-19 pandemic,
                may also introduce shifts in music that would be interesting to
                explore. Overall, this analysis can help us better understand how
                music serves as both a reaction to and a driver of cultural change.

            <h2>About the Data</h2>
            <p>
                The data we will be using was sourced from the Kaggle 15,000
                Music Tracks - 19 Genres (w/ Spotify Data) dataset. The dataset
                contains 15,150 rows and 18 columns. It is a collection of popular
                songs spanning from 1923 to 2023. It categorizes each song by a
                combination of objective and subjective metrics. Some examples
                of objective features are the track title, artist name, release
                year, duration, and tempo. Some examples of subjective features
                are danceability, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, and
                valence. It was collected from Spotify by scraping hits by genre
                and removing all duplicate track title + artist entries. It is
                important to note that although the dataset contains 15,150 rows,
                there are only 10,400 unique songs. This is because certain songs
                appear in duplicate rows to represent cases where multiple artists
                are credited on the same song. The data is free to use under an
                MIT license.

            <div class="visualization-container" style = "position: relative;">
                <h3>Average Duration Per Decade</h3>
                <div style="position: absolute; right: 20px; top: 10px;">
                    <label for="genreSelect">Select Genre: </label>

                <p class="vis-description">
                    This line plot illustrates how the average song duration has changed over the decades for each musical genre. 
                    One of the most striking takeaways is how consistent song lengths have remained overallâ€”regardless of genre, 
                    most songs fall between 200 and 350 seconds, or roughly 3 to 5 minutes. A notable exception is jazz, 
                    which peaked at nearly 10 minutes in the 2000s.

                    The "All" line, which averages durations across all genres, reflects this consistency well. 
                    This trend likely stems from the longstanding influence of radio formatting, which favors tracks around
                     3 minutes in length. For example, Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody initially struggled to get airplay due to its 
                     unusually long runtime.
                    
                    Looking within individual genres, we see interesting deviations. EDM, 
                    for instance, shows a clear linear decline in duration over time, 
                    while R&B saw a noticeable spike in average song length during the 1960s to 1980s. 
                    These patterns suggest that while song structure norms persist, each genre evolves 
                    in its own way in response to cultural and technological shifts.

                </div>
                <p class="vis-description">
                    This heatmap shows the correlations between the subjective features in our dataset. Becuase qualities like "Danceability"
                    or "Valence" are open to interpretation, we visualize the relationship between these attributes to see how their values trend together.
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is a strong negative correlation (-0.71) between Acousticness and Energy. This may suggest that acoustic songs tend to be calmer. Or it may
                            indicate a bias in the data author to perceive acoustic songs as less energetic compared to other instrumental styles such as electronic or percussive.
                        </li>
                        <li>There is a moderate positive correlation (0.48) between Danceability and Valence. This intuitively aligns with tendency of songs which are popular
                            in party or club atmospheres to evoke positive feelings in the listener, whether through upbeat rhythms, bright melodies, or feel-good lyrics.
                        </li>
                        <li>All other features are weakly correlated. This suggests that many qualities of a song vary independently from one another. For example, the presence of
                            a live audience in a track doesn't tend to hold any predictive power over whether the song contains many lyrics, or is purely instrumental.
                        </li>
                        <li>One noteworthy insight from this matrix is that speechiness and instrumentalness don't have a strong negative correlation, as one might intuitively assume.
                            This may be due to the presence of longer songs, where the instrumentality and lyrics may balance each other out, or because the nature of many lyrical
                            songs to still incorporate a large proportion of instrumental sections. If spoken word poetry were present in the dataset, to counteract the presence
                            of purely instrumental tracks, we would likely see a stronger negative trend.
                        </li>

                <div id="danceability-chart" class="vis-box"></div>
                <p class="vis-description">
                    The data suggests that danceability often rises during or shortly after significant crisesâ€”such as the Great Depression or the 2008 global recessionâ€”possibly 
                    because audiences gravitate toward more upbeat, energetic music as a form of comfort and escapism during challenging periods. From the early 1970s through the 1980s, 
                    danceability shows a noticeable surge corresponding to the Disco Era, when dance-oriented music dominated the charts. In contrast, after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic 
                    in 2020, danceability dips slightly, which could indicate a shift toward slower, more introspective songs reflecting the mood of the time. Overall, these fluctuations hint 
                    that broader cultural and socio-economic factors can significantly influence the stylistic characteristics of popular music.

                <p class="vis-description">
                    This visualization shows, for a selected year, the number of top songs of each genre. This effectively highlights what genres were trending at specific points in time. 
                    The genre count also, at times, corresponds with important historical events. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, metal is by far the most prominent genre. 
                    Metal has 38 top songs; the next highest genre, rap, has 22. This reflects a sense of angst and turmoil that many were experiencing. In 1929, the year the Great Depression began, 
                    the blues genre has 15 top songs - this is triple the value of the next highest genre. This similarly corresponds to societyâ€™s sullenness at the time. During the disco era (1970s), 
                    pop and disco genres naturally dominated. This reflects the lighthearted, experimental energy of society during this time. Finally, from 2020-2023 
                    (the years most heavily impacted by COVID-19), the today genre dominates. This corresponds to the need for connectedness that people sought during times of isolation.

            <h2>Summary and Conclusions</h2>
            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <p>
                Our data exploration and analysis has uncovered several important findings. First, song duration has almost entirely remained within a range of 3 to 5 minutes. There are some deviations 
                and trends for particular genres, which are explored above, but the duration remains generally persistent. Another key finding was that the strongest correlation between any two song qualities 
                was a correlation of -0.71 between Acousticness and Energy. This is indicative of acoustic instruments and songs being perceived as relaxed. Besides one other moderate correlation, which is 
                discussed above, all other features share a weak correlation. This might indicate how different and unique music is - there is a lot of variation between individual songs. Another notable finding 
                is that danceability seems to be correlated with significant negative historical events. Danceability rises during or immediately after these points in time. This may be due to people yearning to 
                feel positively in the face of crisis, or to celebrate getting through the crisis once it is over. Finally, it is apparent that genre also reflects the general outlook of society. More upbeat genres 
                are popular during times of prosperity and hope, and more negative genres are popular in times of trouble.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What We Learned</h3>
            <p>
                From our analysis, we have learned about the impact that society's predominant outlooks and events can have on music. It is evident that music is a reflection of the times - it is a way for people 
                to express themselves and their views on the world around them. This has been true for the past century, and is likely to be true of both the more distant past and future. Music can be studied by 
                historians to analyze the dominating perspectives and moods of historical eras. 
            </p>
            
            <h3>Future Work</h3>
            <p>
                There is certainly more work that can be done in this area. As stated earlier, it is likely that music has been a reflection of society for all of history. Therefore, analyzing music from the more 
                distant past will likely yield results that can be used to discover the thoughts of the time. This could be particularly useful for times and places that have little documentation. It has the potential 
                to uncover unknowns about past societies. Another area that could be expanded upon is popular music across the world. If a factor such as country of origin were to be explored, a country's global influence 
                may be traceable.

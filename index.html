            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Music is a universal language that evolves alongside society,
                reflecting cultural shifts, technological advancements, and
                historical events. Analyzing music data trends over time provides
                valuable insights into what styles, genres, and themes resonate
                with listeners. From an artist's perspective, understanding these
                trends can help shape creative decisions and predict what will be
                popular in the future. Additionally, contextualizing music trends
                with historical events offers a unique perspective on how music
                both influences and is influenced by the world around it. This
                involves cross-analyzing shifts in musical themes, genres, and
                popularity with major societal changes. For example, protest songs
                surged during the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War, with
                artists like Bob Dylan and Marvin Gaye using music as a form of
                activism. Similarly, the rise of electronic and dance music in
                the late 20th century coincided with technological advancements
                and the growth of club culture. Economic downturns, such as the
                2008 financial crisis, and global events like the COVID-19 pandemic,
                may also introduce shifts in music that would be interesting to
                explore. Overall, this analysis can help us better understand how
                music serves as both a reaction to and a driver of cultural change.

            <h2>About the Data</h2>
            <p>
                The data we will be using was sourced from the Kaggle 15,000
                Music Tracks - 19 Genres (w/ Spotify Data) dataset. The dataset
                contains 15,150 rows and 18 columns. It is a collection of popular
                songs spanning from 1923 to 2023. It categorizes each song by a
                combination of objective and subjective metrics. Some examples
                of objective features are the track title, artist name, release
                year, duration, and tempo. Some examples of subjective features
                are danceability, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, and
                valence. It was collected from Spotify by scraping hits by genre
                and removing all duplicate track title + artist entries. It is
                important to note that although the dataset contains 15,150 rows,
                there are only 10,400 unique songs. This is because certain songs
                appear in duplicate rows to represent cases where multiple artists
                are credited on the same song. The data is free to use under an
                MIT license.

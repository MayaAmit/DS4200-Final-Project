            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Music is a universal language that evolves alongside society,
                reflecting cultural shifts, technological advancements, and
                historical events. Analyzing music data trends over time provides
                valuable insights into what styles, genres, and themes resonate
                with listeners. From an artist's perspective, understanding these
                trends can help shape creative decisions and predict what will be
                popular in the future. Additionally, contextualizing music trends
                with historical events offers a unique perspective on how music
                both influences and is influenced by the world around it. This
                involves cross-analyzing shifts in musical themes, genres, and
                popularity with major societal changes. For example, protest songs
                surged during the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War, with
                artists like Bob Dylan and Marvin Gaye using music as a form of
                activism. Similarly, the rise of electronic and dance music in
                the late 20th century coincided with technological advancements
                and the growth of club culture. Economic downturns, such as the
                2008 financial crisis, and global events like the COVID-19 pandemic,
                may also introduce shifts in music that would be interesting to
                explore. Overall, this analysis can help us better understand how
                music serves as both a reaction to and a driver of cultural change.

            <h2>About the Data</h2>
            <p>
                Our data was sourced from Kaggle's 15,000 Music Tracks - 19 Genres 
                (w/ Spotify Data) dataset. The dataset contains 15,150 rows and
                18 columns. It is a collection of popular
                songs spanning from 1923 to 2023. It categorizes each song by a
                combination of objective and subjective metrics. Some examples
                of objective features are the track title, artist name, release
                year, duration, and tempo. Some examples of subjective features
                are danceability, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, and
                valence. It should be noted that because the data author information
                is unavailable on Kaggle, we recognize that the subjective metrics
                may be subject to heavy bias. Music, as an artform, is inherently
                a subjective experience. So all of the subjective features are likely
                heavily influenced by the bias of the data author.
                It was collected from Spotify by scraping hits by genre
                and removing all duplicate track title + artist entries. It is
                important to note that although the dataset contains 15,150 rows,
                there are only 13,371 unique songs. This is because certain songs
                appear in duplicate rows to represent cases where multiple artists
                are credited on the same song. To account for this we cleaned the
                data to include only unique tracks. The data is free to use under
                an MIT license.

                  This chart displays the progression of Danceability, Energy, Speechiness, Acousticness, Instrumentalness, Liveness, and Valence over time.
                  Looking at the feature trends over time, we can see distinct patterns that reflect the evolution of popular music over the past century. 
                  Speechiness has remained remarkably consistent, hovering around 0.1 from 1900 to 2023, suggesting that the amount of spoken word in music has changed 
                  little despite other dramatic shifts in production and style. There was also a great decline in Acousticness, which began 
                  gradually but experienced its sharpest drop during the 1970s, coinciding directly with the rise of disco and pop music that embraced electronic instruments, 
                  synthesizers, and production techniques over traditional acoustic sounds. This transformation from acoustic to electronic production represents one of the 
                  most fundamental shifts in popular music's sonic character. During the 1910-1930s period, which encompasses World War I and the interwar years, several 
                  fascinating transitions occurred: Danceability and Valence both reached their lowest points around 1910 before climbing significantly through the 1920s, 
                  potentially reflecting the somber mood during WWI followed by the exuberance of the Roaring Twenties. Simultaneously, Energy began a steady climb from its 
                  lowest point, while Instrumentalness started its long-term declineâ€”changes that coincided with recording technology improvements and shifting cultural priorities 
                  during these tumultuous years. By the 1930s, as the Great Depression took hold, we see increased volatility in features like Instrumentalness and Liveness, 
                  possibly reflecting the music industry's experimentation in response to economic hardship before World War II.

                    <ul class="vis-description">
                        <li>There is a strong negative correlation (-0.71) between Acousticness and Energy. This may suggest that acoustic songs tend to be calmer. Or it may
                            indicate a bias in the data author to perceive acoustic songs as less energetic compared to other instrumental styles such as electronic or percussive.
                        </li>
                        <li>There is a moderate positive correlation (0.48) between Danceability and Valence. This intuitively aligns with tendency of songs which are popular
                            in party or club atmospheres to evoke positive feelings in the listener, whether through upbeat rhythms, bright melodies, or feel-good lyrics.

                            Danceability is somewhat normally distributed, whereas Energy and Valence are slightlyright-skewed, and Liveness is strongly left-skewed.
                            This suggests that there is a mostly constence representation of danceable vs. non-danceable songs. In contrast, songs are more likely to be energetic and positive.
                            And less likely to include the presence of a live audience.

                            The scatter plot shows a weak negative correlation between Instrumentalness and Speechiness.
                            Most data points are clustered near zero on both axes and very few songs have significant values in both at the same time.
                            This supports the intuition that these qualities tend to be somewhat mutually exclusive in music.

                <p class="vis-description">
                    Danceability, Energy, and Valence are three of the most intuitive indicators of a songâ€™s mood, spirit, and overall vibe, making them ideal for analyzing cultural trends over time. 
                    Danceability reflects how rhythmically compelling a track is, often correlating with how lively or socially engaging the music is. Energy captures the intensity and activity level of a song
                     â€” whether itâ€™s calm or chaotic, relaxed or aggressive â€” which can mirror the emotional tempo of a time period. Valence directly measures the positivity or happiness of a song, making it a strong proxy for cultural optimism or gloom.

                    In contrast, features like Speechiness, Acousticness, Instrumentalness, and Liveness are more technical or structural. While important for music production,
                    they arenâ€™t as closely tied to how people emotionally connect with songs or how music reflects the collective mood of a generation.


                    The data suggests that danceability often rises during or shortly after significant crisesâ€”such as the Great Depression or the 2008 global recessionâ€”possibly 
                    because audiences gravitate toward more upbeat, energetic music as a form of comfort and escapism during challenging periods. From the early 1970s through the 1980s, 
                    danceability shows a noticeable surge corresponding to the Disco Era, when dance-oriented music dominated the charts. In contrast, after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic 
                    in 2020, danceability dips slightly, which could indicate a shift toward slower, more introspective songs reflecting the mood of the time. Overall, these fluctuations hint 
                    that broader cultural and socio-economic factors can significantly influence the stylistic characteristics of popular music.

                    This visualization shows, for a selected year, the number of top songs of each genre. This effectively highlights what genres were trending at specific points in time. 
                    The genre count also, at times, corresponds with important historical events. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, metal is by far the most prominent genre. 
                    Metal has 38 top songs; the next highest genre, rap, has 22. This reflects a sense of angst and turmoil that many were experiencing. In 1929, the year the Great Depression began, 
                    the blues genre has 15 top songs - this is triple the value of the next highest genre. This similarly corresponds to societyâ€™s sullenness at the time. During the disco era (1970s), 
                    pop and disco genres naturally dominated. This reflects the lighthearted, experimental energy of society during this time. Finally, from 2020-2023 
                    (the years most heavily impacted by COVID-19), the today genre dominates. This corresponds to the need for connectedness that people sought during times of isolation.

            <h2>Summary and Conclusions</h2>
            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <p>
                Our data exploration and analysis has uncovered several important findings. First, song duration has almost entirely remained within a range of 3 to 5 minutes. There are some deviations 
                and trends for particular genres, which are explored above, but the duration remains generally persistent. Another key finding was that the strongest correlation between any two song qualities 
                was a correlation of -0.71 between Acousticness and Energy. This is indicative of acoustic instruments and songs being perceived as relaxed. Besides one other moderate correlation, which is 
                discussed above, all other features share a weak correlation. This might indicate how different and unique music is - there is a lot of variation between individual songs. Another notable finding 
                is that danceability seems to be correlated with significant negative historical events. Danceability rises during or immediately after these points in time. This may be due to people yearning to 
                feel positively in the face of crisis, or to celebrate getting through the crisis once it is over. Finally, it is apparent that genre also reflects the general outlook of society. More upbeat genres 
                are popular during times of prosperity and hope, and more negative genres are popular in times of trouble.

            <h3>What We Learned</h3>
            <p>
                From our analysis, we have learned about the impact that society's predominant outlooks and events can have on music. It is evident that music is a reflection of the times - it is a way for people 
                to express themselves and their views on the world around them. This has been true for the past century, and is likely to be true of both the more distant past and future. Music can be studied by 
                historians to analyze the dominating perspectives and moods of historical eras. 
            </p>
            
            <h3>Future Work</h3>
            <p>
                There is certainly more work that can be done in this area. As stated earlier, it is likely that music has been a reflection of society for all of history. Therefore, analyzing music from the more 
                distant past will likely yield results that can be used to discover the thoughts of the time. This could be particularly useful for times and places that have little documentation. It has the potential 
                to uncover unknowns about past societies. Another area that could be expanded upon is popular music across the world. If a factor such as country of origin were to be explored, a country's global influence 
                may be traceable.

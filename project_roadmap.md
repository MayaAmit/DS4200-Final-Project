# Final Project Roadmap

A place to plan and think out loud about next steps.

# To Do List:

Gio:

- **DUE 3/18**:  
  - Create the website template in the github  
    - Call D3 in the HTML script.  
    - Create an integration of a simple linear plot.  
    - Message group when done

Caroline & Maya:  
**DUE 3/18:**

- 2 of the visualizations done

TIP: inspect the example project to see how she structured a lot of the code for it

# Project Requirements:

## Overall:

Analyze and visualize a dataset of 15000 songs taken from 100 years of music.

## Data Cleaning:

Must have more than ten features after cleaning and creating additional features.

Recommendations:

- No more than 10000 observations  
  - **NOTE:** Maybe we can drop all duplicate songs and combine the multiple artists into a single “Artists” column.

## Visualizations:

5 Visualizations

- **NOTE:** Or 4 if we present during the first week. Plus 3-5 bonus points. I think signing up to present the first week makes sense as long as none of us have any overlap with some other big final test/project.  
- All with clear titles, labels, and legends if appropriate.  
- At least three with customized settings (color, shape, layout, etc.)  
- At least three kinds of interaction.  
  - Interactive components are meaningful and help people learn more than they would were the plot static.  
- Figures should have similar/complementary styling.

## Webpage:

Includes:

- An introduction to the project, topic, and tasks.  
- A paragraph to introduce the data.  
  - Size  
  - Source  
  - Attributes  
- At least two links to references.  
- At least 5 (or 4 if we present first week) visualizations.  
  - At least 1 made with Altair.  
  - At least 1 made with D3.  
  - No more than two of the same type of plot.  
- A paragraph to explain the takeaway of each visual.  
- All interactivity is well explained and easy to use.  
- A summary:  
  - Key findings.  
  - What we learned.  
  - Suggestions for future work.  
    - Will be asked to talk about 2-3 constructive conclusions/suggestions.	  
- Well formatted.  
- Publish the website.

## Presentation:

Discuss:

- Topics and tasks.  
- Static visualizations, explain the design.  
- Interactive visualizations, how to use it to address the task.  
  - Include a demo.  
- What we learned from the visualization.

Present all the visualizations as a web page, no slides.

## Writing:

- A paragraph about why the data is suitable for the topic and what information may be missing.  
- A paragraph to explain the design idea for each visualization.

# Final Deliverables:

- HTML/CSS/JS to make the website.  
- Any other HTML figures included in the website.  
- Any image files included in the website.  
- A .docx or .txt file to explain the designs.  
  - Include the link to the published website.  
- Python file used to generate the data visualization.  
- D3-related(HTML/JS) to generate the data visualization.
